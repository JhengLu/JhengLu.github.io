Hi! I am a fourth-year Central South University student majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests fall within the Internet of Things (IoT) encompassing machine learning (ML) for IoT, sensor networks, crowdsensing, security, social networks, and wireless networks. I am currently engaged in research under [Prof. Anfeng Liu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/liuanfeng/en/index.htm) and [Prof. Neal Xiong](https://dblp.org/pid/x/NaixueXiong.html) that centers around utilizing incentive mechanisms and machine learning technologies to design and build high-quality mobile crowd sensing systems.
<p>Outside of research, I like to travel, play basketball and guitar, and read books.
