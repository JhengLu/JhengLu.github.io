Hello!

I'm Jiaheng Lu, a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research interests include disaggregated memory, Machine Learning systems and cloud infrastructure management.

I'm fortunate to work with [Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://symbioticlab.org/people/) on [QoS-aware CXL-enabled tiered memory systems](#link_to_paper), and with [Prof. Ang Chen](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chenang/) on a [co-simulation framework for the infrastructure nexus](#Link_to_paper).

Previously, I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) in China, where I worked with [Prof. Anfeng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9RDpn1gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Neal N. Xiong](https://srinfo.sulross.edu/fs/1448) on [Mobile Crowd Sensing systems](https://jiahenglu.com/research/2022-02-28-MCS).

Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, basketball, guitar, and reading.
