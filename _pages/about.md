Hello there! I'm Jiaheng Lu, a first-year master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I'm studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My academic journey commenced at Central South University, China, where I pursued a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. I am deeply engrossed in the realms of Cluster Computing, distributed systems, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
<p>Outside of my studies, I like traveling, playing basketball, strumming the guitar, and reading books.
