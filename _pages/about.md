Hello there!

I'm Jiaheng Lu, a first-year master's student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Network, Communication, and Information Systems. Currently, I'm fortunate to be working at [SymbioticLab](https://symbioticlab.org/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/), conducting research on CXL-enabled disaggregated clouds.

Previously, I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in China, under the guidance of [Prof. Anfeng Liu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/liuanfeng/en/index.htm) and [Prof. Neal N. Xiong](https://srinfo.sulross.edu/fs/1448), focusing on Mobile Crowd Sensing systems. My research interests include Cloud Computing, Cluster Computing, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy traveling, playing basketball, playing the guitar, and reading books.
