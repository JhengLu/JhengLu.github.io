<h2>Abstract</h2>
Mobile Crowd Sensing (MSC) is a powerful paradigm of sensing systems, which collects data from workers to build applications. It is vital to identify truthful workers,
then match sensing data tasks and truthful workers to collect data. We apply matching theory to improve the quality of the MCS system from two aspects, i.e., one is truthful workers discovery, and the other is sensing difference discovery. In the truthful workers discovery phase, we establish an approach to obtain workers' credibility by comparing their report data with Ground Truth Data (GTD) and Sub-GTD. In the sensing difference discovery phase, the workers' sensing quality of different attributes is obtained by comparing Attribute-GTD and Sub-Attribute-GTD. And workers' sensing quality of different locations is attained by the integration of absolute and relative sensing location preference. Combining the two aspects, an effective workers recruitment scheme based on swarm intelligence for MCS, Multi-attribute and Local Matching based Workers Recruitment (MLM-WR), is proposed. MLM-WR utilizes the PSO algorithm to dynamically assign workers. We finally carry out extensive evaluations, where results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art approaches.
