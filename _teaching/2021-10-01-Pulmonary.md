In this research, I built an algorithm based on Adaboost to detect lesion areas in PET-CT images, achieving a detection accuracy of 0.97. And I proposed a WS-GLCM-based feature extraction algorithm and an SVM-based algorithm for 
determining disease status. Besides, I developed a collaborative filtering algorithm-based recommendation model for treatment plans and published a second-authored software copyright.
