In this research, I developed a reliable workers recognition method by judging workers' performance with the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and identified reliable workers, improving the accuracy of identifying trustworthy workers by 36%. I also designed a workers' sensing attribute reliability detection algorithm by calculating worker data deviation against UAV baseline data; besides, I designed a workers' sensing location reliability detection algorithm by using an original optimization framework approach and calculating the degree of 
alignment between worker and UAV data; I improved the reliability of worker sensing attributes by 53% and locations by 55%. Finally, I proposed a recruitment scheme based on swarm intelligence for Mobile Crowd Sensing, combining sensing reliability and recruitment cost; I improved data quality by 27% and cost-savings by 40%.
