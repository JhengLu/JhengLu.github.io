<p>Team Leader (Research Assistant), Advisor: <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/yxliang/en/index.htm">Prof. Yixiong Liang (Central South University)</a> <br> Feb 2022-May 2022</p>
In this research, I innovated a lightweight network structure based on BiSeNet and STDC, achieved a high frame rate (186 fps) on CPU and guaranteed the segmentation effect under high resolution up to 720p. Besides, I achieved an mIoU of 93.9% on Supervisely Person Dataset and deployed the model on the desktop (LibTorch, QT, C++) and Android (LibTorch, JNI, JAVA).
