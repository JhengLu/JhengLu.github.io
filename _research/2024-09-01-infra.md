Critical infrastructures like datacenters, power grids, and water systems are deeply interdependent, forming a complex "infrastructure nexus" that requires co-optimization for efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. We present OpenInfra, a co-simulation framework designed to model these interdependencies by integrating domain-specific simulators for datacenters, power plants, and cooling systems. Built following the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principle, OpenInfra allows seamless integration of diverse simulators and flexible configuration of infrastructure interactions. It addresses challenges such as synchronization, scalability, and data management. Our evaluation demonstrates its capability to simulate large-scale infrastructure dynamics.
