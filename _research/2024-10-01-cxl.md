Tiered memory systems have widely been adopted to provide larger memory capacity in response to increasing memory demands from memory-intensive workloads.
Although increased memory capacity allows more applications to be deployed, existing solutions for tiered memory systems are not built with Quality-of-Service (QoS) support.
As a result, they often cannot meet service-level objectives (SLOs) when multiple applications share a tiered memory system.
Specifically, applications suffer from **local memory contention** and **memory bandwidth interference**, two sources of performance unpredictability unique to tiered memory systems.
Indeed, we observe application performance drops by 43% and 70% during severe memory contention and interference.

This paper presents Mercury, a QoS-aware tiered memory system that provides predictable performance for coexisting memory-intensive applications, each with different SLOs.
Mercury enables per-tier page reclamation to enforce application-level resource management.
It leverages a novel admission control and real-time adaptation algorithm to maximize local memory utilization while mitigating memory interference.
Evaluations with real-world applications show that Mercury can provide QoS guarantees among multiple applications sharing a tiered memory system with up to 53.4% improvement in performance.
